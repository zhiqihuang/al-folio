Hi, I am a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate from Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences at University of Massachusetts Amherst. I work as a research assistant at the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval ([CIIR](https://ciir.cs.umass.edu/)) under the mentorship of my advisor, Dr. [James Allan](https://www.cs.umass.edu/~allan). My research endeavors lie at the intersection of information retrieval, natural language processing, and machine learning (IR/NLP/ML). I work on various IR tasks, such as entity retrieval, multilingual retrieval, multimodal search and query by example, etc.

I received my master in Statistics from the University of Maryland, College Park and my bachelor in Applied Math from Sun Yat-sen University.
